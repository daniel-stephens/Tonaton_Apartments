# APARTMENT PRICING ANALYSIS
Is there a criteria that apartment owners use to price their housings? 
We want to find out in this project. The purpose of this project is to find out factors that affect the pricing.

This project is in 4 parts.
 
## Part 1
### Scraping the Data
The data we need for this project is scrapped from a website in Ghana called tonaton.com. We will write a python script, that collects various features of the apartment we are interested in and stores the data in a MongoDB database

## Part 2
### Cleaning the data
The data we will get will be very messy. We will clean the data and make it as organized as possible following the tidy data criteria:
1.Each variable must have its own column
2.Each observation must have its own row
3.Each type of observational unit forms a table

## Part 3
### Exploring the Data to get some insights.
We will come up with questions the data can answer. We will explore the data to answer the various questions that will be asked. This part will include visualizations.

## Part 4
### Predicting Prices of houses.
We will perform feature engineering on the data, see what features really affect the price and perform machine learning to predict the prices of houses.
